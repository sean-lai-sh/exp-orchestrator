# R&D lab architecture: instruments, agents, sessions

**Date:** 2026-04-28
**Status:** Draft for discussion (not approved, not scheduled)
**Relationship to other docs:**
- `2026-04-28-post-corelink-architecture.md` — narrowly scoped to the
  corelink → NATS broker swap. Still valid; this doc subsumes its goals
  and adds the product-shape framing.
- `2026-04-27-corelink-modular-demo-design.md` — the demo we shipped on
  `main`. The plumbing it built (executor abstraction, env-injected
  plugin contract, canvas UX) survives intact into this product shape.

## Product framing

The orchestrator's natural home is **R&D labs**: places where data
originates from instruments (microscopes, oscilloscopes, sequencers,
spectrometers, sensor rigs), needs lightweight transforms or inference,
and lands in lab-local archives.

The job-to-be-done is concrete: **a researcher has 5 little Python
scripts spread across 3 machines and an instrument's controller PC**.
Today they glue them together with bash, samba shares, and tribal
knowledge. They want to wire the same logic visually, run it on whatever
compute the lab has, and let their PI tweak a knob without becoming a
DevOps engineer.

This is a smaller, more defensible product than "general MLOps platform":

| | MLOps platform | R&D lab orchestrator |
|---|---|---|
| Buyer | Engineering org with a data team | PI / lab manager / staff scientist |
| Compute | K8s cluster | A few workstations + an instrument PC + maybe a small GPU box |
| Data sources | Warehouses, S3, Kafka | Microscopes, sensors, instrument-controller PCs |
| Data destinations | Cloud warehouses, feature stores | Lab NAS, optional S3 archive, sometimes LIMS |
| Compliance | SOC 2, GDPR | IRB, IP, sometimes air-gapped |
| Closest existing tools | Dagster, Airflow, Argo, Ray | NiFi, Node-RED, Meta's labgraph (none with a great canvas) |

We're closer to NiFi/Node-RED/labgraph in shape, with a polished
canvas-driven UX nobody else in this space has nailed.

## Goals

1. **Run anywhere a lab has compute.** Researcher's GPU workstation, a
   shared lab server, the controller PC for an instrument, optionally a
   cloud peering layer. Heterogeneous by default.
2. **Plugins as containers when possible, host processes when forced.**
   Vendor SDKs that only exist on a specific OS, USB-attached devices,
   licensing dongles — these are real and require host execution.
3. **Streaming AND batch in one product.** Live microscope preview is
   streaming; "reprocess yesterday's session through the new model" is
   batch. Both ship in v1.
4. **Session as the first-class run concept.** "Process the data from
   session 2024-04-28-mouse-3" beats "manage a long-running pipeline
   forever".
5. **On-prem-first deployment.** Many labs cannot ship raw data to
   cloud (IP, IRB). The whole stack runs inside a lab's network.

## Non-goals (for this doc)

- Multi-lab federation / shared workflows across institutions.
- Plugin marketplace / paid plugin distribution.
- Hosted SaaS pricing tier (this comes after on-prem credibility).
- Training (compute provided is for inference + transforms; training
  happens off-platform per the user's stated direction).

## Key concepts

### Workers

A **worker** is a registered process running somewhere in the lab — a
researcher's Mac mini, a Windows PC controlling a microscope, an Ubuntu
GPU box. Workers run a small **agent** that:

1. Connects out to the orchestrator backend (firewall-friendly).
2. Advertises its **capabilities**: `{cpu, ram, gpu, os, devices, mounts, network}`.
3. Heartbeats so the orchestrator knows it's alive.
4. Pulls work assignments and runs them — either by `docker run`-ing a
   container locally, or by spawning a host process when the plugin
   declares `runtime: "host"`.

```

                   │  (FastAPI + NATS, today) │   reachable from all workers

   └─────────┘  └─────────┘   └───────────┘   └──────────────┘
```

This **replaces "K8s executor"** as the v1 scheduling model. K8s comes
later for labs that already run it — we add a `KubernetesExecutor`
slot-in, but the worker-agent model is the simple default that fits a
lab who just wants to install an agent on three computers.

### Plugins

A plugin is **code that runs on a worker, wired into the workflow via
inputs and outputs**. Two runtime kinds:

| Kind | Use when | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| `container` | Plugin code is portable, no host-only deps | Caesar cipher, segmentation model in a CUDA container, ETL transforms |
| `host` | Plugin needs vendor SDK, USB device, OS-specific runtime | Microscope-X capture (vendor `.dll`), serial-port reader, fluorescence camera SDK |

Three semantic categories on the canvas:

| Category | Role | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| **Source** | Pulls data into the workflow | Microscope acquisition, file-watcher, API poller, MQTT subscriber |
| **Transform** | In → out, typed | Denoise, dimensionality reduction, model inference, format convert |
| **Sink** | Final destination | Lab NAS write, S3 archive, LIMS push, downstream service |

The canvas's existing `nodeTemplates.ts` grows source/sink categories;
backend's deploy planner stays unchanged in shape (still emits IN_*/OUT_*
env vars per node).

### Sessions and runs

A **session** is the user-meaningful unit of work: one mouse imaging
run, one PCR plate, one fluorescence experiment. Researchers think in
sessions.

A **run** is one execution of a workflow against a session. Runs have:

- A unique `run_id` and `session_id` (the latter chosen by the researcher).
- A start time, end time, status (`running`, `succeeded`, `failed`, `cancelled`).
- An output manifest (artifact URIs).
- Lineage (which inputs produced which outputs).
- Replayability ("re-run this session through the new pipeline version").

This is a meaningful upgrade over today's `deployment_id` / `deployments`
dict. Today's `deploy` ≈ "pipeline launched" with no run history. We'd
extend the schema to:

```
Pipeline (workflow definition)
   ├── version 1
   └── version 2
        ├── Run #1   on session X   (succeeded, artifacts at ...)
        ├── Run #2   on session Y   (failed, rerun)
        └── Run #3   on session Y   (succeeded, artifacts at ...)
```

For streaming pipelines (real-time microscope view), a "session" is the
duration of the live capture. For batch pipelines, it's the dataset
window the run covers.

### Deployment topology

   └────┬────┬────┬───────────┘

        │    │                (host plugin: microscope SDK)
        │    │
        │    └─────────────── agent on GPU workstation
        │                     (container plugin: model inference)

        └──────────────────── agent on lab Mac
                              (container plugin: light transforms)
```

**One backend per lab.** Single small VM or even a Mac mini. NATS +
MinIO + Postgres are all single-binary-friendly. Researchers don't
operate Kubernetes; they install three things from a single installer.

## Streaming and batch in the same product

Both execution shapes are first-class.

### Streaming path (what's already built, modulo broker swap)

Plugin container is long-lived. Subscribes to a NATS subject, reacts to
each message, publishes outputs. Used for:

- Live microscope acquisition with on-the-fly preview/inference
- Real-time enrichment of sensor streams
- Routing / filtering messages between systems

Plugin lifecycle: starts at session-start, lives until session-end (or
until the user clicks "stop").

### Batch path (new)

Plugin container/host-process runs to completion on a finite dataset,
emits artifacts, exits. Used for:

- "Reprocess all images from session X through this new model"
- Daily ingestion from external API
- Periodic feature extraction over a time window
- Backfills

Plugin lifecycle: orchestrator schedules a run, agent dispatches it,
plugin reads input artifacts, writes output artifacts, exits with a
success/failure status. Outputs are addressable by run_id.

### Triggering

Streaming runs trigger on **session start** (manual or sensor-driven
"a new session began" event).

Batch runs trigger on:

- **Schedule** (cron: every hour, every day at 2am)
- **Upstream completion** (run B starts when run A finishes)
- **External event** (a new file landed in `/lab-nas/incoming/`,
  webhook from instrument software)
- **Manual / backfill** (researcher clicks "rerun this session")

The orchestrator backend grows a small **scheduler** subsystem (cron +
event-driven). Could be a thin layer over an existing tool (APScheduler
for cron, watchdog for files) or a small bespoke implementation.

## Plugin contract (extends the corelink-demo contract)

Streaming plugins (container or host) get the same shape as today, with
broker creds replacing corelink:

```
NODE_ID, NODE_TYPE
NATS_URL, NATS_TOKEN, S3_ENDPOINT, S3_BUCKET, S3_KEYS
IN_<TYPE>_SUBJECT, IN_<TYPE>_CONSUMER, IN_<TYPE>_SCHEMA
OUT_<TYPE>_SUBJECT, OUT_<TYPE>_SCHEMA
SESSION_ID, RUN_ID
```

Batch plugins get a different env shape (no streaming subjects; explicit
input/output URIs per run):

```
NODE_ID, NODE_TYPE
SESSION_ID, RUN_ID
S3_ENDPOINT, S3_BUCKET, S3_KEYS
IN_<NAME>_URIS=<json array of artifact URIs>     # produced by upstream runs
OUT_<NAME>_URI=<single URI to write to>
RUN_PARAMS=<json blob of user-set parameters from canvas>
```

When the batch plugin exits 0, the agent reads the OUT URIs that were
written, registers them as run artifacts in the orchestrator, and
flips the run state to succeeded.

Host-process plugins get the same env-var contract; they just run
without container isolation. The agent invokes them directly.

## Scaling characteristics

The architecture is designed to scale by separating control plane
(orchestrator), small-message routing (broker), and large-payload
movement (object storage) into independent layers. Each layer scales
on its own, and the levers don't interact.

### Per-layer ceilings on commodity hardware

| Layer | Single-node ceiling | Cluster ceiling |
|---|---|---|
| Orchestrator backend (FastAPI) | thousands of canvas/API ops/sec | horizontal behind a load balancer |
| NATS broker — small messages | 5–10M msgs/sec/core | linear with cluster nodes |
| NATS broker — aggregate bandwidth | ~1–5 GB/s (NIC-bound) | linear with cluster nodes + leaf nodes |
| MinIO object store — throughput | ~1–3 GB/s | TB/s on multi-node clusters |
| MinIO — capacity | TB | PB+ |
| Postgres (run history) | thousands of writes/sec | partition by tenant when needed |

### The pointer pattern is what makes huge data plane possible

Brokers are NOT designed to push GB-scale payloads through their NICs.
Pushing a 1 GB tensor through NATS even once per second saturates a
10 GbE link. The pointer pattern fixes this: the broker carries small
JSON envelopes (~200 bytes), and bytes ride S3/MinIO out-of-band.

```
Broker bandwidth ÷ envelope size = max sustained pointer rate
1.25 GB/s ÷ 200 bytes ≈ 6 million pointers/sec
```

Each pointer references an arbitrarily large blob. The actual
throughput of the system in MB/sec is bounded by the **slowest of**:

1. The producer's blob upload to S3
2. The S3 read for the consumer
3. The plugin's processing speed

Not by broker bandwidth. That's the whole point.

### Scaling levers

When a real workload pushes against a ceiling, here's what to pull —
each is self-contained, no architectural redesign:

| Bottleneck observed | Lever |
|---|---|
| Broker can't keep up with envelope rate | Add NATS cluster nodes; subjects auto-distribute |
| Pointer envelopes themselves growing too big | Reference shared blob, only emit deltas |
| S3 reads too slow | MinIO cluster with more disks; parallel multipart download |
| One plugin too slow on hot stream | Add plugin replicas to a NATS consumer group; broker load-balances |
| Cross-host blob transfer too slow | NVMe-over-Fabric / RDMA for hot paths; or co-locate plugin with source |
| Plugin can't fit dataset in RAM | Stream-process — read S3 blob in chunks, don't materialize whole thing |
| Need cross-DC / cross-lab replication | NATS leaf nodes; MinIO bucket replication |
| Postgres writes lagging on run-history insertion | Partition `runs` table by `pipeline_id` or `session_id` |

### Co-locating plugin with source for sustained high bandwidth

For instruments that produce sustained multi-GB/s streams (high-speed
cameras, light-sheet microscopy, electrophysiology arrays), the
architecture lets you run the first transform plugin **on the same
host as the source**. Worker-agent scheduling makes this explicit:
the canvas node declares `requirements: {host_local_to: source_node}`
or similar, and the orchestrator schedules accordingly.

Once the data is reduced (compressed, downsampled, feature-extracted)
on the source host, downstream plugins can pick it up via the broker
without saturating the lab network.

### Concrete lab-workload sizings

| Workload | Sustained data rate | Architecture says |
|---|---|---|
| Confocal microscopy | ~50–100 MB/s | Single NATS + single MinIO. Trivial. |
| Light-sheet microscopy | ~500 MB/s – 1 GB/s burst | Single NATS for pointers; MinIO with NVMe SSD for blobs; plugin streams chunks. |
| Single-cell sequencing | ~10s GB per session, batch | Batch path; runs to completion. Trivial. |
| Live electrophysiology (multi-channel) | ~10 MB/s continuous | Streaming path. Trivial. |
| High-speed camera, ~10 GB/s | sustained, high | Co-locate first transform plugin on the camera host (agent on same machine); transform reduces bandwidth before broker sees it. |
| Many cameras × many sessions × federated labs | massive | NATS cluster with leaf nodes across DCs; MinIO federated cluster; agents scattered widely; orchestrator sees deploys as ordinary records. |

### Where this stops scaling

There's a soft ceiling at workloads that need **sub-millisecond
latency on TB/sec aggregate streams** — e.g., autonomous-vehicle
sensor fusion, real-time MRI reconstruction with sub-frame deadlines,
financial market data. At that point you're looking at:

- DPDK / RDMA / kernel-bypass networking
- Aeron, ZeroMQ over shared memory
- Custom binary protocols
- Specialized hardware (FPGAs, NICs with onboard compute)

R&D labs almost never operate there. The instruments researchers
actually run produce data measured in MB/s to a few GB/s, comfortably
inside what NATS + MinIO + worker-agents handle on commodity hardware.

### What scales the orchestrator, not the data plane

Some scaling questions are about the **control plane**, not data:

| Concern | Lever |
|---|---|
| Many concurrent canvas users | Orchestrator behind LB; Convex / Postgres scales reads |
| Many active deploys at once | Stateless orchestrator + Postgres for run history; horizontal replicas |
| Many registered worker agents | NATS for agent comms; orchestrator polls scheduler queue, not all agents directly |
| Schema-driven plugin validation | Cache schemas; lookup at deploy time, not per-message |

These are normal web-app scaling concerns; they don't touch the
data-plane architecture and aren't blocked by it.

## Migration arc

This is not a big-bang rewrite. The current demo is small and
intentionally modular; growing it into the lab product is incremental.

### What stays unchanged

- **Canvas UX** (`frontend/components/canvas/`). Adding source/sink
  categories is data-only (`nodeTemplates.ts` extension).
- **Deploy planner shape** (`backend/deployment.py`). Still emits
  IN_*/OUT_* env vars per node. The "stream type" abstraction
  generalises to NATS subjects, S3 URIs, etc.
- **Executor abstraction** (`backend/executors/`). The `Executor` ABC
  becomes one of two parallel ABCs: `Executor` (container streaming) and
  `BatchExecutor` (run-to-completion). Adding a `WorkerAgentExecutor`
  is a slot-in.
- **Frontend ↔ backend deploy contract**. The `/deploy` endpoint
  evolves into `/runs` + `/pipelines`, but the canvas POSTs the same
  workflow shape.

### Step-by-step migration

**Step 0 (done):** corelink-modular demo on `main`.

**Step 1 — corelink rip-out + NATS swap** (per existing
`2026-04-28-post-corelink-architecture.md`). ~1 week.

**Step 2 — worker agent v0**. ~2 weeks.
- Tiny Python agent: registers via WS to orchestrator, heartbeats,
  receives `start_container(spec)` / `start_host_process(spec)` commands,
  reports back status + logs.
- New `WorkerAgentExecutor` in `backend/executors/agent.py` that picks
  a registered worker matching the node's `requirements`.
- Runs alongside `LocalDockerExecutor`. Researcher can pick "run on
  agent X" or "run locally".

**Step 3 — sessions and runs**. ~2 weeks.
- Backend schema: add `pipelines` (versioned workflow defs), `runs`
  (executions of a pipeline, scoped to a session), `artifacts` (URIs
  produced by runs).
- Postgres replaces in-memory `deployments` dict.
- Canvas grows a "Runs" view: history per pipeline, artifacts per run,
  rerun button.

**Step 4 — batch execution path**. ~3 weeks.
- New `BatchExecutor` ABC with `submit_job` / `wait` / `result`.
- Plugin contract additions for batch (URI-based env vars).
- Canvas: nodes can be marked `kind: batch` (default streaming).

**Step 5 — scheduler**. ~2 weeks.
- Cron triggers, file-landing triggers, upstream-completion triggers.
- Reuse APScheduler or build a small bespoke loop.

**Step 6 — host-process plugins on agents**. ~1 week.
- Agent supports `runtime: "host"` plugins: invokes the plugin's entrypoint
  directly with env vars set, captures stdout/stderr.
- Critical for instrument-PC plugins.

**Step 7 — installer / on-prem deployment story**. ~2 weeks.
- One-binary lab server bootstrap (orchestrator + NATS + MinIO +
  Postgres in compose / nomad / k3s).
- Agent installer (`curl | sh` style for Linux/Mac, `.msi` for Windows).
- Documentation: "from zero to first run in 30 minutes."

That's roughly 13 weeks of focused work to a credibly demoable lab
product. None of it requires throwing away the demo code we shipped.

## Open product questions

1. **Authentication for agents**: shared-secret tokens (simple), client
   certs (medium), JWT/OAuth (heavy). Labs vary in security posture.
2. **What to do about Windows-host plugins on Mac dev machines**: do we
   support cross-OS dev, or do plugin authors need a Windows worker for
   debugging?
3. **Versioning model for pipelines**: every save creates a new version,
   or explicit "publish" gesture? Affects UX and the runs table.
4. **Live-preview UX during streaming runs**: do we surface stream
   contents in the canvas (e.g., show the latest microscope frame
   inline)? Big UX win for researchers, real engineering investment.
5. **Where does the lab NAS sit in the model**: as a special filesystem
   sink, or as a generic `mount:` capability that an agent advertises
   and plugins use?

## Decision required before this becomes an implementation plan

- **Agent transport**: NATS (consistent with data plane) or HTTP/SSE
  (simpler, but two protocols)? Recommend NATS — same deployment, one
  cluster connection per agent.
- **Postgres for run history vs. continuing with in-memory + file
  artifacts**: real DB is necessary as soon as runs become first-class.
  Probably yes from step 3 onward.
- **Worker-agent v0 in Python or Go**: Python matches the rest of the
  backend; Go gives a smaller binary for `.msi` packaging on Windows.
  Recommend Python for v0 (faster to ship, agents can be re-implemented
  later if binary size matters).
- **Should batch jobs share the agent fleet, or run as ECS/K8s
  one-shot pods**: probably share the agent fleet for the lab-on-prem
  case; ECS/K8s for cloud-peered batches.

Once these are decided, this doc hands off to `writing-plans` to produce
a concrete task list, the same shape as the corelink-demo plan.
